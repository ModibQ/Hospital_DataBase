Welcome to my Project!

Downloaded the drivers:

API Link (SLF4J): https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc#download

SQL JDBC Driver Link (JBDC): https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/releases

To Run:

Open the Extra Credit Folder with Visual Studio Code and compile and run SQLJDBC.java and all the queries will run and give you the results in the terminal. If you run the test once and it deletes all negative tests. The query will be altered so if you want a revert the database file and run it again, there is an extra database file in the Project folder called "final.db" which you can use to replace the current database with it to run the tests again.
